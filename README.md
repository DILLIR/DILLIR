## 👋 Hello World! DILLIR Here 

I'm an experienced front-end developer with over 5 years of layout experience. I use modern technologies in my projects, such as React and GrqphQL. I know how to create an outstanding functional site or web-application. Also, I strive to develop, learn new technologies, deepen what I already know
and work in a team on interesting projects.

## 🎨 What I Do:

- React Developer: I build sleek, efficient, and user-friendly interfaces that make the web a beautiful place. With React, I bring ideas to life with interactive and dynamic web applications.

- TypeScript Enthusiast: Writing clean, maintainable code is my jam. TypeScript is my tool of choice for adding that extra layer of reliability and type safety to my projects.

## 👨🏻‍🎓 What I'm Learning:

- Front-end Development: Trying new things like bun.js or getting better in next.js.
- Back-End Development: Venturing into the server-side world with Node.js and Express, I'm on a mission to become a full-stack wizard.
- Databases & APIs: Diving into the depths of databases and API integrations to create seamless, end-to-end solutions.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), Typescript
- React.js
- Node.js
- Material UI
- REST API, GraphQL
